            <p> Timebox. Just the sound of it makes me shudder. However, reading through the materials, I found most of it interesting. Meditation has long been a peripheral interest of mine. Flow state? I enjoy that, although only when I’m in my flow. For
                me it comes down to what Jonathan says in counterintuitive productivity.

            <p> I enjoy a good race just as much as the next person raised in competitive sports. What rubs me the wrong way is the notion that by somehow optimizing life to the nth degree, perfection will be achieved. I can see the value of timebox for specific
                instances. Okay, we are going to do x. One hour, go. But I know I thrive off variety. Setting the stakes high sometimes is great. But if it becomes the default, I often find that I lose more than I gain by missing out on the offerings
                of other approaches. I don’t have any inherent objections to boxes. It is just that once we get into box and linear mindsets, the easiest thing to do is to stay there. So long as boxes remain agreements that are constantly being affirmed
                by consciously consenting parties, they can serve. As soon as they become rules, rigid and serving nought but their own rigidity, I think it is time to circle round again. But I suppose I shall just have to try timebox over the coming
                months and see how it feels.
