              <p> The premise of the Search Inside Yourself (SIY) course is quite simple. As the man with the job title of ‘Jolly Good Fellow’ at Google Chade-Meng Tan says, "…the real reason we started SIY is that I want to create the conditions for happiness for
                my coworkers and for the world." In order to package this for the market, Tan documents all the ways in which people who have trained themselves to be happy using mindfulness are better workers. Last year his organization was nominated
                for the noble peace prize.
            </p>
            <p> Their approach is simple. Use the very basic human capacity of attention to cultivate, “a calm and clear mind on command." They use cutting edge science to illustrate that there is far more going on in the world then we are aware of. A prime
                example is of the literal gut intuition, a physical reaction taking place before the mind consciously grasps a situation. Learn to be attentive they say, and you will learn to control your relationship to the world by noticing elusive
                signs and making choices before consequences unfold.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of this is great and wonderful. Having semi-consciously, and with wavering attention, experimented with similar approaches since my early teens, I have experienced the benefits of ‘two minutes of mindfulness a day’ and other such practices. I think
                it is important to note though that these are just one layer of the onion. A question I have been carrying for years centers around the role of passion. Recently I had an experience with a co-worker/boss that I found illustrative in this
                regard. Core to the mandate of the organization we were working in is the importance of finding the growing edge for society and the organization’s staff concurrently. If you aren’t growing yourself, learning about and changing your patterns,
                and pushing yourself to be more loving each day, you need to find another job. Not because they no longer value you as a human being, but simple because that is core to how the organization functions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon joining the organization I was soon relied upon for my even temper, shrewd discernment, and ability to learn quickly. As the months passed, this colleague often asked me to find small ways to not just excel at completing my tasks, but to do so on
                my growing edge. To find ways to be more loving in how was I working. One day it came to a head. This colleague had observed certain patterns and asked me about them during a regular check-in we had. In that moment I had a choice. I could
                continue in a dispassionate way and converse with them about the topic they had identified without actually touching it internally. We could observe it objectively from outside. Or I could take it on as a part of me. I chose to let it
                fill me. My colleague was astonished. At our next check-in they shared that the fire in my eyes alone had been enough to make them uncertain about whether they could continue to do this deeper level of work with me. I shared that it was
                an on off switch and I would be happy to keep my process to myself, but if this colleague wanted to do the deeper work with me, this fire was part of the process. It is who I am.
            </p>
            <p>
                I share this because I am curious about the role of our messy passionate selves in creating a more beautiful, peaceful, and loving world. I do not doubt the importance of developing mindfulness, learning to listen completely to another without letting
                our attention wander, or preempting emotional states with body awareness. But when exploring the layers of the onion, I think we have to be careful to not become, as a dear friend referred to it, mindless. Not to become so ensconced in
                perfecting equilibrium that we lose our humanity. Search inside for your whole self, not just some parts.

                (P.S. I do not think that Chade-Meng Tan would necessarily disagree with me. I am simply elaborating upon a specific part which I feel is important. Then again, maybe he would. Either way I’m sure he would do it happily.)
