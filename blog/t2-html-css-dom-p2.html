            <p> There are many different ways to achieve a layout on a webpage. One of the most popular ways is “the grid”. It is achieved using a base layer of rows that stretch across the entire page, and using varied column widths within each row to create
                boxes. One major advantage of this is that if the columns are constructed using percentages, it is easy to make a grid “responsive” i.e. grow and shrink in accordance with users screen size. This wasn’t a big deal fifteen years ago when
                nearly all users were on desktops or laptops, but these days many users have two or three different access points for the web, and each of this is a different size.

            <p> To help humans and machines understand what is what on a website, semantic structure is often used. Naming something “header” or “footer” or “nav” (navigation bar) can make code a lot easier to decipher. Web development is full of such pockets
                of meaning, and new ones are always being built, as bit by bit, or byte by byte, people create digital frameworks for our lives.
