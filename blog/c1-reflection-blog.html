            <p> While watching Shereef’s digital fireside talk, a few things stood out to me. The first is that while DBC has been marketed from the beginning as a, “learn enough so that somebody will pay you to keep learning” experience, the entire model
                is based on “learning for the joy of learning.” Without this second part, it does not work.
            </p>
            <p> This is very exciting to me because education which isn’t founded in a love of learning feels very empty. I am looking forward to engaging in this culture of learning. I appreciate being able to follow my inspiration when learning, while still
                having a path through the woods to follow so that I don’t just walk in circles. Nothing in the talk changed my expectation of EDA but it (pardon the pun) light my fire and filled me with excitement to be embarking on this journey. I can
                see that there will be many challenges along the way which cut right to the core of who I am and how I work, and I know there will be many more challenges that I have no inkling of at this time, and I look forward with curiosity to all
                of them.
