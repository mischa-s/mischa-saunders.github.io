            <p> Learning web development in 2016 begins with Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML). It is a simple language that almost anybody can learn. Once you have a basic understanding of HTML, you will then learn Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). If HTML is
                the bread, CSS is the butter. Sure you could get all the information/filing stuff from bread/HTML, but we need flavour. We need design. We need the buttery (and maybe even jammy) goodness of CSS. Both CSS and HTML function on a Document
                Object Model (DOM).
            </p>
            <p> Switching analogies, the relationship between HTML/CSS/DOM is similar to one found in western pop music. When the song is first written, the lyrics and music on paper are the HTML. When the song gets recorded or played, that is
                the CSS, the styling of it. All of it is done in DOM, just as all western pop music is created using the heptatonic scale <em>do re me fa sol la te do</em>. One could use another system of organization to DOM, but just like nobody writing western
                pop music seems likely to ever use a different scale, googling alternatives to DOM is equivalent to an archaeological dig.

                Forgetting about pop music, the actual process of designing websites today is more like a Russian doll of boxes. You make one box around everything. Then within the big box you identify the next size of box(es), cutting up the content into more and more
                particular boxes until each box only has one object or element in it. Then the page can be coded using the DOM model, with each object being identified by naming it in the order of the boxes it fits into, i.e. its box heredity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Continuing with boxes inside boxes, one other crucial element to understand is that each of the individual objects/elements that have been isolated has their own set of attendant boxes. These include the border around the element, the padding inside the
                  border surrounding the element, and the margin surrounding the border.  Boxes inside boxes!s
